## Section 1: INTRODUCTION
This program's goal is to help the end user discover what cell phone provider has the best plan for the user's given situation.
This will be accomplished through multiple questions in this program that cover a variety of variables, such as line amount or military status.
The program will then compute information from a database and compare the final values after the questionnaire, leading the user to an answer.

## Section 2: USAGE
The program is relatively simple: a series of questions will be asked to a user, and their answers will allow the program to compare the price between the three different providers in the area with the user's given options. The best is then printed to the user, along with final monthly price.

## Section 3: CONTRIBUTIONS
If there is an error, or you would like to contribute with a suggested change, leave relevant information within the proper GitHub sections.

## Section 4: OTHER INFORMATION
The developers of this program are Nasir Martin, William Wiggins, and Marques Wright.
